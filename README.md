This project is for the 2024 5C Hackathon

Team members: Aimee Co, Santiago Burgos-Fallon, Emily Zhu, Jack Chin

In response to the uncertainty and stress surrounding housing selection at Pomona College, our group created a convenient and user-friendly website for the Maker track that falls under the Beginner Hack and 5C Hack overlays. Our housing selection website aims to ease and improve the notoriously anxiety-inducing housing process to make the experience more streamlined and navigable. 

We built the frontend using Next.js, TypeScript, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, and the backend using Python served with Flask. To use our website, the user simply signs in to their school account and enters their name, class year, and housing time. Then, they will be directed to a full map of the campus, where they can click on a specific dorm building to view its detailed floor plan. From there, they can see which rooms they are able to select and which ones are claimed through an intuitive coloring system. To claim a room, the user simply clicks on the room, and their name, year, and housing time is entered into the space. Students are prioritized based on their room draw times, so those with earlier times can automatically choose from unclaimed rooms and can take rooms chosen by people with later times. This allows students to have a better idea of the room options available for their housing time, and will result in a smoother and less stressful experience during their actual housing selection.
